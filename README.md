# Create: Source & Steel

C:S&S is a little side project to make a custom minecraft modpack with createfied recepies for Mekanism, Ars, AE2 and sort of a planned progression through the game, making you dive deep in create and tfmg machines and automations to progress through the pack.

## The main goal

With the purpose of integrating mods, the pack aims to retain the core concepts of each one without altering too much. Recipes tend to get out of the crafting table or single machines to need more complex work and a create way of automating. With AE2 tied to the later phases of the progression, create's logistics will stand out a lot more and will be a viable solution instead of skipping directly to AE2. Mekanism will also be later on the progression because of it's overpowered tools and stuff that tend to overshadow anything else in the early game.

## Concepts and Changes

### Recipes

Here I aim to for no changes to create or tfmg recipes since they are the core of the game. Everything else is subject to change to satisfy and favor the create way of making, although, by keeping each mod's progression and resource requirements in mind to not change it from the developer's intended way.

### Steel

Mekanism's way of making steel is gated behind create:tfmg steel which involves more steps and machines to make.

### Circuits

With a major overhaul of all circuit production inspired by create:tfmg you will need to create assembly lines and resource automation for getting into AE2 and Mekanism.

### Mekanism Chemicals and infuser

Here I plan to remove the ability to directly insert item and turn them into chemicals inside the infuser. Instead I plan the need to prepare each chemical in mixing basins with distiled water or other base and later use mekanism's machines for that.

### Resource automation and renewability

While still in early phase of deveopment the resorce automation and renewability isn't figured out yet. Late game OP mods like replication and ProjectE are being considered but for the early phases of the game there's no clue on how to go about it yet.
